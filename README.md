# Installing Windows 10 on Lenovo 14e Chromebook

This repository documents my personal experience installing Windows 10 on the Lenovo 14e Chromebook, originally shipped with Chrome OS.

## 🔧 What Was Done:
- Enabled Developer Mode
- Removed hardware write protection
- Installed custom UEFI firmware (MrChromebox)
- Created a bootable Windows installer
- Performed a clean installation of Windows 10
- Installed drivers from CoolStar’s Chromium OS driver project

> ⚠️ Important: This process is experimental and involves risks. It will erase all data on the device and may void your warranty. I take no responsibility for any damage or loss.

## 🧠 Why?
This was a project to revive an old Chromebook by turning it into a usable Windows laptop for basic tasks like browsing, documents, and media.
